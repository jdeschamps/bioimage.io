# How to contribute tests summaries

As BioImage.IO community partner may contribute test summaries. As defined in [bioimageio.core](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/d435fcdb38c8b2152ac0d20f61ee498d88e7f1d0/bioimageio/core/common.py#L4) a test summary is a dictionary with the following keys:
 - name: str
 - source_name: str
 - status: Literal["passed", "failed"]
 - error: Union[None, str]
 - traceback: Optional[List[str]]
 - nested_errors: Optional[Dict[str, dict]]
 - bioimageio_spec_version: str
 - bioimageio_core_version: str
 - warnings: dict

In the [BioImage.IO collection template](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/blob/main/collection_rdf_template.yaml), where a community partner is registered, the location of `test_summaries` and how to trigger them can be specified as well.
The location of partner test summaries is specified by a GitHub repository `repository`, where test summaries are hosted in `deploy_branch`/`deploy_folder`.
To update the test summaries (for new or updated resources) `workflow` specifies a GitHub Actions workflow to trigger from `workflow_ref` by @bioimageiobot. 
For the automatic trigger machanism to work the partner `repository` needs to invite @bioimageiobot as a collaborator and the `workflow` needs to run on `workflow_dispatch` with a `pending_matrix` input.

Let's take a look at an example: the [ilastik partner entry](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/blob/aa4742d33394809e44e63ce48f9bac9ad3518122/collection_rdf_template.yaml#L63-L68
) below specifies that test summaries are hosted at [ilastik/bioimage-io-resources/tree/gh-pages/test_summaries](https://github.com/ilastik/bioimage-io-resources/tree/gh-pages/test_summaries). 
The [test_bioimageio_resources.yaml](https://github.com/ilastik/bioimage-io-resources/blob/main/.github/workflows/test_bioimageio_resources.yaml) is regularly dispatched by @bioimageiobot to keep test summaries up-to-date.

```yaml
id: ilastik
repository: ilastik/bioimage-io-resources
branch: main
collection_file_name: collection.yaml
test_summaries:
  repository: ilastik/bioimage-io-resources
  deploy_branch: gh-pages
  deploy_folder: test_summaries
  workflow: test_bioimageio_resources.yaml
  workflow_ref: refs/heads/main
```

The test summaries are expected to follow the folder/file name pattern "<resource_id>/<version_id>/test_summary_*.yaml", where * can be any string to differentiate different test settings.

## Display of partner test summaries

Once a community partner is registered to contribute test summaries with the `test_summaries` data explained above, the main [BioImage.IO CI](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/blob/main/.github/workflows/auto_update_main.yaml) collects these summaries. The collection including these collected test summaries are displayed on bioimage.io. Currently test summaries are rendered like so:

## Updating test summaries

The main [BioImage.IO CI](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/blob/main/.github/workflows/auto_update_main.yaml) triggers the partner's CI for new or updated resources.
Additionally, the parter may decide at any time to rerun (some of) their tests if changes on their side (like a new version release of their software) requires additional tests or a reevaluation.
